# Vest Investment Committee Platform - Gap Analysis

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Current Implementation vs. Requirements Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the delta between the current Vest implementation and the full requirements specified in the Technical Specifications Document. While the foundation is solid with 10 functional pages and core infrastructure, several critical workflow features and specialized agent views are missing.

**Completion Status**: ~60% of MVP features complete

---

## 1. PAGES & NAVIGATION

### ✅ Implemented Pages (10)
1. **Dashboard** - Portfolio overview with workflow navigator
2. **Research Pipeline** - Research request management with AI agents
3. **IC Meeting** - Investment committee meeting interface
4. **Portfolio** - Portfolio positions overview
5. **Monitoring** - Original monitoring page
6. **Monitoring Hub** - Enhanced thesis health tracking
7. **Documents** - Document management
8. **Debate Room** - Real-time AI-human collaboration
9. **Historical Meetings** - Meeting timeline and history
10. **Agent Outputs** - Generic AI agent response browser

### ❌ Missing Critical Pages
1. **IC Workflow Timeline** - Complete workflow progression view (Discovery → Analysis → IC → Execution → Monitoring)
2. **Proposal Creation** - Form to create investment proposals from research
3. **Specialized Agent Output Details** - Dedicated views for each agent type:
   - Research Brief detailed view
   - Financial Model view (DCF with interactive charts)
   - Quantitative Analysis view (factor exposures, risk metrics)
   - Document/Report view
   - Risk Analysis detailed view
   - Scenario Analysis results view

### ⚠️ Navigation Issues
- No clear workflow progression links (Research → Create Proposal → IC Meeting)
- Agent outputs don't link to specialized detail views
- Missing breadcrumbs showing current position in workflow
- Sidebar doesn't reflect workflow organization

---

## 2. AI AGENTS

### ✅ Implemented Agents (5 of 16)
1. **Research Synthesizer** - Generates research briefs
2. **Financial Modeler** (DCF Modeler) - Creates valuation models
3. **Contrarian Analyst** - Provides bear case analysis
4. **Scenario Simulator** - Models portfolio impact scenarios
5. **Thesis Monitor** - Tracks thesis health

### ❌ Missing Agents (11 of 16)
**Pre-Work Agents**:
- Quant Analyst (factor analysis, risk metrics)
- Document Generator (formatted reports)

**In-Session Agents**:
- Data Retrieval Specialist (historical precedents, comps)
- Voice Synthesizer (audio summaries)

**Post-Session Agents**:
- Minutes Scribe (automated meeting minutes)
- Trade Order Generator (execution tickets)
- Risk Reporter (pre-trade risk memos)
- Attribution Analyst (performance attribution)

**Sleeper Agents**:
- Market Event Monitor (real-time price/news alerts)
- Compliance Monitor (regulatory checks)
- Risk Regime Monitor (continuous risk tracking)

**Impact**: Core agents exist for basic workflow, but missing agents reduce automation benefits and completeness of the platform.

## 3. WORKFLOW FEATURES

### ✅ Implemented Workflows
- Research request creation and tracking
- IC meeting interface with real-time collaboration
- Portfolio position monitoring
- Thesis health tracking
- Historical meeting review

### ❌ Missing Critical Workflows
1. **Proposal Creation Flow** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - No way to convert research into formal investment proposals
   - Missing form for: Ticker, Recommendation (BUY/SELL/HOLD), Target Weight, Thesis, Catalysts, Risks
   - No connection between research phase and IC meeting phase

2. **IC Package Preparation**
   - No automated IC package compilation
   - Missing pre-IC document assembly

3. **Trade Execution Workflow**
   - No trade order generation from IC decisions
   - Missing execution monitoring

4. **Complete Workflow Timeline**
   - No visual representation of full workflow progression
   - Missing stage-by-stage artifact tracking

---

## 4. DATA FEATURES

### ✅ Implemented Database Schema (9 tables)
- companies, positions, proposals, ic_meetings, votes
- agent_responses, financial_models, thesis_monitors
- market_events, notifications

### ✅ Implemented Features
- Full CRUDL operations for research requests
- IC meeting creation and management
- Voting system
- Notification system
- PDF export (memos, minutes, summaries)

### ❌ Missing Features
1. **Proposal Management**
   - CREATE proposal endpoint exists but no UI
   - No proposal review workflow
   - Missing proposal-to-meeting linking UI

2. **Workflow Stage Tracking**
   - Database schema has workflow_stages but underutilized
   - No visual tracking of entity progression through stages

3. **Agent Output Organization**
   - Generic agent output browser exists
   - Missing specialized views by agent type
   - No filtering/search by output characteristics

---

## 5. USER EXPERIENCE GAPS

### Navigation & Flow
- **Issue**: User cannot easily progress from Research → Proposal → IC Meeting
- **Impact**: Broken user journey, unclear next steps
- **Fix Required**: Add "Create Proposal" button from research, link proposals to IC meetings

### Agent Outputs
- **Issue**: All agent outputs shown in generic list view
- **Impact**: Cannot fully appreciate different output types (DCF models vs. risk analysis)
- **Fix Required**: Build specialized detail pages per agent type

### Workflow Visibility
- **Issue**: No overview of where investments are in the pipeline
- **Impact**: Users lose context of overall workflow state
- **Fix Required**: Build IC Workflow Timeline page

---

## 6. PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Critical for MVP (Must Build)
1. **Proposal Creation UI** - Enable converting research to proposals
2. **IC Workflow Timeline** - Show complete workflow progression
3. **Fix Navigation** - Connect Research → Proposal → IC Meeting flows

### Priority 2: Important for Completeness (Should Build)
4. **Specialized Agent Detail Pages** - Research, Financial Model, Risk views
5. **Proposal List in IC Meeting** - Show proposals under consideration
6. **Enhanced Navigation** - Clear workflow organization in sidebar

### Priority 3: Nice to Have (Can Defer)
7. Complete remaining 11 agents
8. Trade execution workflow
9. IC package compilation
10. Advanced filtering and search

---

## 7. TECHNICAL DEBT

### Strengths
- Solid TypeScript foundation with full type safety
- PostgreSQL persistence - no data loss
- WebSocket infrastructure working
- Professional UI with shadcn/ui

### Areas for Improvement
- Some pages (Documents, Monitoring) are placeholder-heavy
- Agent output rendering is generic, not specialized
- Navigation between workflow stages is unclear
- Missing breadcrumbs and workflow context

---

## 8. ESTIMATED EFFORT

### Phase 1: Critical MVP Features (Current Sprint)
- **Proposal Creation**: 2 hours
- **IC Workflow Timeline**: 2 hours  
- **Navigation Fixes**: 1 hour
- **Specialized Agent Views**: 3-4 hours
- **Total**: ~8-9 hours

### Phase 2: Completeness (Future Sprint)
- Remaining 11 agents: 15-20 hours
- Trade execution workflow: 4-5 hours
- Advanced features: 10-15 hours

---

## 9. RECOMMENDATIONS

To deliver a "compelling product" as requested:

1. **Immediately Build**:
   - Proposal creation feature
   - IC Workflow Timeline page
   - Specialized agent output detail views
   - Fix navigation to create clear user journey

2. **Can Defer**:
   - Additional agents (11 remaining)
   - Trade execution workflow
   - Advanced filtering/search

3. **Quality Focus**:
   - Ensure existing features are polished
   - Test complete user flows end-to-end
   - Professional design throughout

---

## 10. CONCLUSION

The Vest platform has a solid foundation with core infrastructure, database persistence, and key workflows implemented. However, to be truly compelling, it needs:

1. **Complete the user journey** - Research → Proposal → IC Meeting → Execution
2. **Specialized agent experiences** - Showcase different agent capabilities with appropriate UIs
3. **Workflow visibility** - Make the IC process transparent and trackable

With the priority 1 items implemented (~8-9 hours of work), the platform will deliver a complete, compelling MVP that demonstrates the full value proposition of AI-assisted investment committee workflows.

---

**Next Steps**: Proceed with Priority 1 tasks in the following order:
1. Proposal Creation UI
2. IC Workflow Timeline
3. Navigation Fixes
4. Specialized Agent Views
