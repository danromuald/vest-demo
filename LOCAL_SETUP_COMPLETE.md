# Local Setup - Complete & Ready! üéâ

All fixes have been applied. Your local Docker setup will now have the same data as this Replit environment.

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Driver Issue
**Problem**: Seed script used Neon WebSocket driver for local PostgreSQL  
**Fix**: Auto-detects environment (Neon vs local PG) and uses correct driver

### 2. Missing OPENAI_API_KEY
**Problem**: App crashed without API key  
**Fix**: Added dummy key to `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.local`

### 3. Replit Warnings
**Problem**: Console warnings about REPLIT_DOMAINS in development  
**Fix**: Suppressed warnings in development mode

### 4. Missing GOOGL/AMZN Data
**Problem**: Seed script skipped GOOGL/AMZN proposals if NEE existed  
**Fix**: Updated seed check to only skip if ALL data exists (NEE + GOOGL + AMZN)

## üöÄ Quick Start (Updated)

```bash
# On your MacBook:
cd vest-demo

# Clean everything and start fresh
make clean
make run-all
```

**That's it!** This now seeds the COMPLETE dataset.

## üìù Files Changed

1. `server/db.ts` - Dual driver support (Neon + pg)
2. `server/lib/openai.ts` - Fallback API keys
3. `server/replitAuth.ts` - Development mode warnings
4. `docker-compose.yml` - OPENAI_API_KEY added
5. `.env.local` - OPENAI_API_KEY added
6. `.env.example` - Documentation updated
7. `scripts/seed.ts` - Fixed skip logic for GOOGL/AMZN
8. `Makefile` - Better error handling
9. `package.json` - Added `pg` and `@types/pg` packages

## ‚úÖ Verification Commands

After `make run-all` completes:

```bash
# 1. Check app is running
open http://localhost:5000

# 2. Check GOOGL/AMZN proposals exist
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT ticker, status, analyst FROM proposals WHERE ticker IN ('GOOGL', 'AMZN');"

# Expected output:
#  ticker | status  |    analyst
# --------+---------+----------------
#  GOOGL  | DRAFT   | user-demo-1
#  AMZN   | PENDING | user-analyst-1

# 3. Check GOOGL/AMZN research completed
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT ticker, status FROM research_requests WHERE ticker IN ('GOOGL', 'AMZN');"

# Expected output:
#  ticker | status
# --------+-----------
#  GOOGL  | COMPLETED
#  AMZN   | COMPLETED

# 4. Check agent responses exist
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT DISTINCT ticker FROM agent_responses WHERE ticker IN ('GOOGL', 'AMZN');"

# Expected output:
#  ticker
# --------
#  GOOGL
#  AMZN

# 5. Check logs for confirmation
make logs
# Should see: "üìä Using local PostgreSQL database"
# Should see: "Creating proposals for GOOGL and AMZN..."
# Should see: "‚úÖ Database seeded!"
```

## üîÑ Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start your day
make start          # Start services with logs

# Make code changes (hot reload enabled)

# Database changes
npm run db:push     # Sync schema

# End your day
make stop           # Stop services
```

## üßπ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Seeding fails with Error 137
**Cause**: Docker out of memory  
**Fix**: Docker Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí Increase Memory to 4GB+

### Issue: Port 5432 already in use
**Cause**: Local PostgreSQL running  
**Fix**: `brew services stop postgresql` or change port in docker-compose.yml

### Issue: Data still missing after reseed
**Cause**: Old data preventing full seed  
**Fix**:
```bash
make clean          # Nuclear option - deletes everything
make run-all        # Fresh start
```
