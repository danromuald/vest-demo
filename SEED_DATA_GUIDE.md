# Comprehensive Seed Data Guide - Vest Platform

## Overview

The seed script now creates diverse, realistic data across multiple research scenarios and workflow stages. This guide explains all the data that will be seeded locally and how to test each scenario.

## Complete Data Scenarios

### Research Requests (7 scenarios across different states)

| Ticker | Company | Status | Has Proposal? | Priority | Button Shown |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **CVX** | Chevron | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | ‚ùå NO | HIGH | **"Create Proposal"** |
| **GOOGL** | Alphabet | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | ‚úÖ YES | MEDIUM | **"View Proposal"** |
| **AMZN** | Amazon | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | ‚úÖ YES | HIGH | **"View Proposal"** |

## Database Verification

Check data directly in PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Check research requests
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT ticker, status, proposal_id IS NOT NULL as has_proposal FROM research_requests;"

# Check proposals
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT ticker, status, analyst FROM proposals ORDER BY created_at;"

# Check agent responses
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT ticker, agent_type, COUNT(*) FROM agent_responses GROUP BY ticker, agent_type ORDER BY ticker;"

# Check workflows
docker compose exec postgres psql -U vest -d vest_db -c \
  "SELECT ticker, current_stage, status FROM workflows;"
```

**Expected Counts:**
- Research requests: 7 (CVX, GOOGL, AMZN, OXY, META, TSLA, NVDA)
- Proposals: 6 (NEE, NVDA, CVX, OXY, GOOGL, AMZN)
- Workflows: 4 (NEE, NVDA, CVX, OXY)
- Agent responses: 40+ total
  - NEE: ~32 (all 16 agents x 2 instances)
  - GOOGL: 2 (Research + DCF)
  - AMZN: 2 (Research + DCF)
  - CVX: 2 (Research + DCF)
  - OXY: 2 (Research + DCF, both DRAFT)

## Key Testing Checklist

- [ ] CVX shows "Create Proposal" button (COMPLETED research, no proposal)
- [ ] GOOGL shows "View Proposal" button (COMPLETED research, linked proposal)
- [ ] AMZN shows "View Proposal" button (COMPLETED research, linked proposal)
- [ ] Clicking "View Analysis" on CVX shows Research Brief + DCF Model
- [ ] Creating proposal from CVX works and links back to research request
- [ ] NEE workflow shows full monitoring with 3 events
- [ ] CVX IC meeting shows active debate session
- [ ] Proposals page shows all 6 proposals
- [ ] Agent outputs page shows responses for all tickers
- [ ] Database queries return expected counts

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Create Proposal" not showing for CVX

**Cause**: Database wasn't properly cleaned or seed was skipped

**Fix**:
```bash
make clean  # Nuclear option
make run-all  # Fresh seed
```

### Issue: Seed says "already seeded - skipping"

**Cause**: Existing data detected

**Fix**:
```bash
# Force complete reset
make clean
make run-all

# OR manually drop/recreate database:
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d postgres
make run-all
```

### Issue: Wrong data showing (e.g., proposals from wrong analysts)

**Cause**: Old data from previous runs

**Fix**: Always use `make clean` before reseeding to ensure fresh state

### Issue: Missing agent responses

**Cause**: Seed check detected partial data and skipped creation

**Fix**: `make clean && make run-all` for fresh seed

## Summary

After running `make clean && make run-all`, you will have:

‚úÖ 7 research requests in various states (COMPLETED, IN_PROGRESS, PENDING)
‚úÖ **CVX with "Create Proposal" button** (main test scenario)
‚úÖ GOOGL & AMZN with "View Proposal" buttons
‚úÖ 6 proposals across different workflow stages
‚úÖ 4 complete workflows (NEE and NVDA in MONITORING, CVX in IC_MEETING, OXY in ANALYSIS)
‚úÖ 40+ agent responses covering all major agent types
‚úÖ 3 IC meetings with debate sessions
‚úÖ 6 monitoring events
‚úÖ 5 users with different roles
‚úÖ 8 companies across 3 sectors

**Your local environment will match Replit with comprehensive, realistic data! üéâ**
